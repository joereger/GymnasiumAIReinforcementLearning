# Active Context: Cart Pole Solutions

**Current Work Focus (Cart Pole):**
- Environment has been successfully solved using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with sophisticated reward engineering
- Completed comprehensive documentation of the solution in Memory Bank, particularly in `approaches.md`
- Implemented environment-specific data directory (`data/cart_pole/`) for model persistence

**Recent Changes (Cart Pole):**
1. **Enhanced Reward Engineering Implementation:**
   - Added multi-component reward system with center bonuses, position penalties, velocity penalties, and recovery bonuses
   - Implemented progressive position penalties that increase with distance from center
   - Created directional velocity penalties (stronger for moving away from center than toward center)
   - Added recovery bonuses that scale with position and improvement

2. **Critical Bugfix:**
   - Resolved issue where perfectly stable balancing was preventing episode termination
   - Implemented explicit success recognition and forced termination at 500 steps

3. **Memory Bank Documentation:**
   - Completed detailed documentation in `approaches.md` covering the DQN algorithm implementation, reward engineering, results, and insights
   - Updated `progress.md` to reflect the solved state of the environment

**Next Steps (Cart Pole):**
- **Potential Refinements:**
  - Test alternative neural network architectures for optimization
  - Experiment with simplified reward formulations that might achieve similar results
  - Explore alternative algorithms like PPO or Actor-Critic for comparison
  - Update `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` with more specific implementation details

**Active Decisions and Considerations (Cart Pole):**
- **Balancing Dual Objectives:** The solution successfully balances the dual objectives of pole stabilization and position control, which the default environment reward doesn't address
- **Reward Engineering Complexity:** While the reward system is complex with multiple components, each component serves a specific purpose in teaching the agent proper behavior
- **Model Persistence:** Confirmed the importance of environment-specific data directories for saving models and preventing cross-environment interference

**Learnings and Insights (Cart Pole):**
- **Reward Engineering Effectiveness:** The sophisticated reward system proved extremely effective, teaching behaviors not incentivized by the default environment reward
- **Stability Achievement:** The agent achieved such perfect stability that it could maintain balance indefinitely, requiring explicit termination logic
- **Critical Components:** Directional velocity penalties were particularly important for preventing dangerous momentum buildup
- **Recovery Mechanism Success:** The position-scaled recovery bonus system effectively encouraged corrective behavior when drifting toward edges

The Cart Pole environment is now considered solved, with both high performance and comprehensive documentation. Future work would focus on refinement, optimization, or exploring alternative approaches.
