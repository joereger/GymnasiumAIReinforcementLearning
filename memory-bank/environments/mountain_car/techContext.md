# Tech Context: Mountain Car Solutions

This document outlines the technologies, libraries, and specific configurations used primarily for developing solutions for the Mountain Car environment.

**Core Libraries (Beyond Global Project Context):**
- **NumPy:** Essential for handling state vectors and any numerical computations for function approximation.
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras:** (Specify if a deep learning framework is used in `mountain_car_discrete.py`, e.g., for a DQN).

**Key Python Packages (Specific to Mountain Car):**
- **Tile Coding Libraries:** (If tile coding is used, specify the library or custom implementation details).
- (List any other Python packages particularly important for Mountain Car solutions).

**Development & Experimentation Tools:**
- **Checkpointing:** (How models or Q-tables/approximators are saved/loaded for Mountain Car solutions).
- **Visualization:** (Specific plotting for learning curves, value function visualization over the 2D state space, or agent trajectories).

**Hardware Considerations:**
- **GPU Usage:** Typically not required for discrete Mountain Car solutions unless a complex DQN is used. Continuous versions with actor-critic methods might benefit.

*(This file will be updated as specific technologies or configurations are identified from the `mountain_car_discrete.py` solution and any future solutions.)*
