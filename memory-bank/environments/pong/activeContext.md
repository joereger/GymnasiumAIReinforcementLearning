# Pong Active Context

## Current Status (Last Updated: 5/11/2025)

We have **pivoted from DQN to PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** for the Pong environment, with significant improvements to the implementation. The PPO algorithm has been enhanced with robust logging, visualization, training continuity features, and optimized for longer training runs.

## Current Implementation

Our current focus is on the **improved PPO implementation** (`pong_ppo.py`, renamed from `pong_ppo_train.py`) with the following key characteristics:

1. **Environment Wrappers**: We've consolidated the environment wrappers into a dedicated module (`pong_env_wrappers.py`) ensuring:
   * Proper frame preprocessing (grayscale, resizing to 84x84)
   * Frame stacking (4 frames) in channels-first format for PyTorch
   * Essential Atari-specific wrappers including `FireResetEnv`, `NoopResetEnv`, etc.
   * Reduced action space of 3 actions (STAY, UP, DOWN) for efficiency
   * Automatic sound disabling for training

2. **PPO Architecture**:
   * Actor-Critic network with shared CNN backbone
   * Separate policy (actor) and value (critic) heads
   * Uses Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
   * Implements the clipped surrogate objective for stability
   * Includes entropy regularization to encourage exploration

3. **Optimized Hyperparameters**:
   * Learning rate: 2.5e-4
   * Gamma (discount factor): 0.99
   * GAE Lambda: 0.95
   * Clip epsilon: 0.2
   * Multiple optimization epochs (4) per rollout
   * Rollout length: 128 steps
   * Normalized advantages for reduced variance
   * **Total timesteps: 25 million** (increased for thorough learning)

4. **Enhanced Training Infrastructure**:
   * Episode-based evaluation (every 500 episodes)
   * Model checkpointing (every 100 episodes)
   * Best model tracking and preservation (`ppo_pong_best.pt`)
   * Training progress visualization with unified charts
   * Small exploration during evaluation (epsilon=0.05)
   * **Training continuity** - ability to stop and resume training

5. **Improved Visualization & Logging**:
   * Combined metrics visualization with multiple axes
   * Compact single-line per-episode logging
   * Time formatting in HH:MM:SS format
   * Episode-organized JSON data for easier analysis
   * Real-time progress tracking

6. **User Interaction**:
   * Optional real-time visualization during training
   * Support for loading previous models to continue training
   * Interactive model selection for loading

## Next Steps

1. **Long PPO Training**: Run the PPO implementation for the full 25 million timesteps to reach optimal performance. The extended training should allow the agent to master Pong completely.

2. **Performance Analysis**: Conduct thorough analysis of learning curves and agent behavior:
   * Track reward progression over time
   * Analyze policy and value loss trends
   * Evaluate entropy decay patterns

3. **Hyperparameter Refinement**: Based on performance patterns during extended training:
   * Consider adjusting entropy coefficient as training progresses
   * Evaluate learning rate decay options
   * Tune GAE lambda for more stable advantage estimates

4. **Documentation & Visualization**: Create comprehensive documentation of the results:
   * Generate detailed performance charts
   * Create videos of the best-performing agent
   * Analyze common gameplay strategies learned by the agent

## Discontinued Approaches

The DQN implementation has been set aside due to learning instability issues, specifically:
* Potential issues with value overestimation
* Sensitivity to initialization
* Long replay buffer warmup requirements
* Difficulty in coordinating target network update frequency

We've preserved the diagnostic tools from the DQN implementation for reference and future analysis.
