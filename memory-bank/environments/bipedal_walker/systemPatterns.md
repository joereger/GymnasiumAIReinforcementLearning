# System Patterns: Bipedal Walker Solutions

This document outlines system-level patterns, architectural choices, and common structures observed or employed specifically within the solutions developed for the Bipedal Walker environment.

**Common Patterns Across Bipedal Walker Solutions:**
- **Agent Class Structure:** (Describe if there's a common way agent classes are structured, e.g., methods for `act`, `learn`, `save_model`, `load_model`).
- **Neural Network Architectures:** (Detail common architectures for actor and critic networks if applicable, e.g., number of layers, types of layers, activation functions frequently used for this environment).
- **Observation Preprocessing:** (Any specific preprocessing steps applied to the 24-dimensional observation vector before feeding it to the agent, e.g., normalization, feature scaling).
- **Action Postprocessing/Clipping:** (How continuous actions are handled, e.g., clipping to the environment's valid range [-1, 1]).
- **Replay Buffer Implementation:** (If applicable, describe common structures or libraries used for replay buffers in algorithms like DDPG, TD3, SAC).
- **Logging and Metrics:** (Common metrics tracked during training, e.g., episode reward, episode length, loss values. How these are logged or visualized).

**Patterns Specific to A3C (`bipedal_walker-a3c.py`):**
- **Worker Management:** (How parallel workers are created, synchronized, and how gradients are aggregated).
- **Global Network Updates:** (Mechanism for updating the global actor and critic networks).

**Patterns Specific to Genetic Algorithm (`bipedal_walker_plus_genetic_algorithm.py`):**
- **Population Representation:** (How individuals in the population are represented, e.g., direct encoding of neural network weights).
- **Fitness Evaluation:** (Details of the fitness function used to evaluate individuals).
- **Selection, Crossover, Mutation Operators:** (Specific implementations or choices for these genetic operators).

*(This file will be updated as common patterns are identified or refined during the development and analysis of solutions for the Bipedal Walker environment.)*
