# System Patterns: Mountain Car Solutions

This document outlines system-level patterns, architectural choices, and common structures observed or employed specifically within the solutions developed for the Mountain Car environment.

**Common Patterns in Mountain Car Solutions (`mountain_car_discrete.py`):**
- **State Discretization / Function Approximation:**
    - Given the continuous state space (position, velocity), a common pattern is to use tile coding, radial basis functions, or a simple neural network to approximate the value function (Q-values). Describe the specific method used in `mountain_car_discrete.py`.
- **Agent Class Structure:** (Structure of the agent, e.g., methods for action selection, learning/updating Q-values).
- **Q-Learning or SARSA Variant:** (Identify the specific temporal difference learning algorithm used).
- **Exploration Strategy:** (e.g., Epsilon-greedy with decay, optimistic initialization).
- **Learning Loop:** (Typical structure: interaction, state processing, Q-value update).

*(This file will be updated as common patterns are identified or refined from the `mountain_car_discrete.py` solution and any future solutions for this environment.)*
