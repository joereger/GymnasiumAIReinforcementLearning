# Active Context: Cart Pole Solutions

**Current Work Focus (Cart Pole):**
- Initial setup of Memory Bank files for the Cart Pole environment.
- Placeholder content created for `environment_brief.md`, `approaches.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, this `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

**Recent Changes (Cart Pole):**
- Created all foundational Memory Bank files within the `memory-bank/environments/cart_pole/` directory.

**Next Steps (Cart Pole):**
- **Populate `approaches.md`:** Review `cart_pole.py` to determine the algorithm used and fill in details about its implementation, hyperparameters, results, and learnings.
- **Populate `systemPatterns.md`:** Identify and document system patterns from the `cart_pole.py` code.
- **Populate `techContext.md`:** Detail any specific technologies used in the `cart_pole.py` solution.
- **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the current status of the implemented approach for Cart Pole.
- Begin experimentation or refinement of the Cart Pole solution if requested.

**Active Decisions and Considerations (Cart Pole):**
- How to best document the (likely simpler) solution in `cart_pole.py` compared to more complex environments.

**Learnings and Insights (Cart Pole - Initial Memory Bank Setup):**
- The standardized Memory Bank structure adapts well even to simpler environments like Cart Pole.
