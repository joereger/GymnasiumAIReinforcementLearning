# Tech Context: Bipedal Walker Solutions

This document outlines the technologies, libraries, and specific configurations used primarily for developing solutions for the Bipedal Walker environment. This complements the overall project `techContext.md` by focusing on environment-specific details.

**Core Libraries (Beyond Global Project Context):**
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras:** (Specify if a particular deep learning framework is predominantly used for Bipedal Walker solutions, e.g., if `bipedal_walker-a3c.py` uses PyTorch). Note if different approaches use different frameworks.
- **Specific RL Libraries/Implementations:** If any solutions use libraries not listed in the global `techContext.md` or use them in a very specific way for Bipedal Walker (e.g., a custom A3C implementation vs. a library version).

**Key Python Packages (Specific to Bipedal Walker):**
- (List any Python packages that are particularly important or unique to solving Bipedal Walker, beyond the common ones like `numpy` or `gymnasium`. For example, specific optimization libraries, or libraries for advanced plotting of Bipedal Walker results).

**Development & Experimentation Tools:**
- **Checkpointing:** (How models are saved and loaded during training for Bipedal Walker solutions. Specific formats or libraries used).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** (Any tools or specific methodologies used for tuning hyperparameters for Bipedal Walker agents, e.g., Optuna, Ray Tune, or manual search).
- **Visualization:** Beyond `visualization_utils.py`, are there any specific plotting techniques or tools used to analyze Bipedal Walker agent behavior or learning curves (e.g., TensorBoard for logging detailed metrics from PyTorch/TensorFlow).

**Hardware Considerations (If Applicable):**
- **GPU Usage:** (Are GPUs typically required or beneficial for training Bipedal Walker agents? Any specific GPU libraries or configurations used, e.g., CUDA versions).
- **CPU Parallelism:** (For algorithms like A3C, note the typical number of CPU cores utilized).
