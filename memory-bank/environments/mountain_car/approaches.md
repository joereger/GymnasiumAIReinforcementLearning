# Approaches: Mountain Car

This document details the different solution approaches implemented or explored for the Mountain Car environment. The existing solution is for the discrete version (`mountain_car_discrete.py`).

## Approach 1: (Discrete Version Solution)

- **Source File:** `mountain_car/mountain_car_discrete.py`
- **Algorithm:** (To be determined by reviewing `mountain_car_discrete.py` - likely Q-learning with function approximation (e.g., tile coding) or a simple DQN, given the discrete action space and sparse rewards).
- **Key Hyperparameters & Configuration:**
    - (To be filled in by reviewing `mountain_car_discrete.py` - e.g., learning rate, discount factor, exploration strategy, details of function approximation if used, network architecture for DQN).
- **Results & Performance:**
    - (To be filled in - e.g., average steps to reach the goal, success rate, learning curve).
- **Learnings & Insights:**
    - (To be filled in - e.g., effectiveness of the chosen algorithm for sparse rewards, impact of state representation/discretization, challenges in exploration).

*(This file will be updated as more details about the approach are documented or as new approaches are developed, potentially including solutions for the continuous version of Mountain Car.)*
