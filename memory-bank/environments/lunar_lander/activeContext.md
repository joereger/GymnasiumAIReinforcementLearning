# Active Context: Lunar Lander Solutions

**Current Work Focus (Lunar Lander):**
- Initial setup of Memory Bank files for the Lunar Lander environment.
- Placeholder content created for `environment_brief.md`, `approaches.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, this `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

**Recent Changes (Lunar Lander):**
- Created all foundational Memory Bank files within the `memory-bank/environments/lunar_lander/` directory.

**Next Steps (Lunar Lander):**
- **Populate `approaches.md`:** Review `lunar_lander.py` to determine the algorithm used and fill in details about its implementation, hyperparameters, results, and learnings.
- **Populate `systemPatterns.md`:** Identify and document system patterns from the `lunar_lander.py` code.
- **Populate `techContext.md`:** Detail any specific technologies used in the `lunar_lander.py` solution.
- **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the current status of the implemented approach for Lunar Lander.
- Begin experimentation or refinement of the Lunar Lander solution if requested.

**Active Decisions and Considerations (Lunar Lander):**
- Determining whether the existing `lunar_lander.py` targets the discrete or continuous version of the environment, as this will significantly impact documentation.

**Learnings and Insights (Lunar Lander - Initial Memory Bank Setup):**
- The structured approach remains consistent and helpful for organizing context for Lunar Lander.
