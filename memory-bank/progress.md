# Progress: Gymnasium Environment Solutions

**Overall Project Status:** Initializing Memory Bank structure.

**What Works (Project Level):**
- Core concept for Memory Bank structure defined (folder-per-environment).
- Initial top-level Memory Bank files created:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`

**What's Left to Build (Project Level - Memory Bank Setup):**
- This `progress.md` file.
- The `memory-bank/environments/` directory.
- Subdirectories within `memory-bank/environments/` for:
    - `bipedal_walker`
    - `cart_pole`
    - `lunar_lander`
    - `mountain_car`
- Standard set of Memory Bank files within each environment-specific subdirectory:
    - `environment_brief.md`
    - `approaches.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
    - `progress.md`
- `.clinerules` file to define Memory Bank access rules (or update global custom instructions).

**Current Status of Environments (High-Level):**
- **Bipedal Walker:** Existing solutions (`bipedal_walker_plus_genetic_algorithm.py`, `bipedal_walker-a3c.py`, `bipedal_walker.py`). Memory Bank files to be created.
- **Cart Pole:** Existing solution (`cart_pole.py`). Memory Bank files to be created.
- **Lunar Lander:** Existing solution (`lunar_lander.py`). Memory Bank files to be created.
- **Mountain Car:** Existing solution (`mountain_car_discrete.py`). Memory Bank files to be created.
- **Other Environments:** Not yet started.

**Known Issues (Project Level):**
- None related to Memory Bank setup at this moment.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Decision made to adopt a hierarchical, folder-per-environment Memory Bank structure to ensure context isolation and clarity.
