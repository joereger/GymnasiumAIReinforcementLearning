# Progress: Mountain Car Solutions

**Overall Status (Mountain Car):** Memory Bank files initialized. The existing solution (`mountain_car_discrete.py`) needs to be documented within this Memory Bank structure.

**What Works (Mountain Car - Memory Bank):**
- All standard Memory Bank files for Mountain Car have been created with placeholder content:
    - `environment_brief.md`
    - `approaches.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
    - This `progress.md` file.

**What's Left to Build (Mountain Car - Documentation & Solution):**
- **Detailed Documentation in `approaches.md`:**
    - Review `mountain_car_discrete.py`: Document its algorithm, hyperparameters, performance, and learnings.
- **Documentation in `systemPatterns.md`:** Extract and document system patterns from `mountain_car_discrete.py`, particularly regarding state representation.
- **Documentation in `techContext.md`:** Detail specific technologies used in the `mountain_car_discrete.py` solution.
- **Solution Refinement/Development:** (Based on future tasks)
    - Potentially improve the existing discrete solution.
    - Explore solutions for the continuous version of Mountain Car.

**Current Status of Implemented Approach (`mountain_car_discrete.py`):**
- Status: Implemented.
- Nature of solution: Discrete action space. (Specific algorithm to be documented).
- Performance: (To be documented).
- Next Steps: Document in `approaches.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

**Known Issues (Mountain Car Solution):**
- (To be filled in as the solution is reviewed or new issues arise, e.g., "Slow learning due to sparse rewards").

**Evolution of Decisions (Mountain Car):**
- (To be filled in if any significant design changes occur).

*(This file will track the progress of documenting and refining solutions for the Mountain Car environment.)*
