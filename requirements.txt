# Core Reinforcement Learning and Utilities
gymnasium==1.1.1
pygame==2.6.1
numpy==1.25.2  # Changed from 2.2.5 to be compatible with tensorflow (<2.0.0, >=1.23.5)
matplotlib==3.10.3
cloudpickle==3.1.1
Farama-Notifications==0.0.4 # Assumed current as not in `pip list --outdated`
typing-extensions==4.13.2 # Explicitly added due to previous conflict, ensure it's compatible or adjust
opencv-python>=4.5.0 # For preprocessing in Atari environments

# Deep Learning Frameworks
torch==2.7.0
torchvision==0.22.0 # Updated to latest available, for compatibility with torch 2.7.0

# TensorFlow/Keras for cart_pole.py (macOS specific version)
tensorflow-macos==2.16.2

# Specific Environment Dependencies
box2d-py==2.3.8 # For BipedalWalker, LunarLander
ale-py>=0.8.0 # For Atari environments including Freeway

# --- Notes ---
# The list above includes primary dependencies. Versions updated based on dependency requirements.
# Previous conflict was resolved by:
# 1. Downgrading numpy from 2.2.5 to 1.25.2 to satisfy tensorflow's requirement (numpy<2.0.0,>=1.23.5).
#
# If further conflicts persist, try removing specific version pins to let pip resolve dependencies.
# For example, you might try: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade --no-deps` and then
# `pip check` to see if there are any issues with the installed packages.

# Environment-specific notes:
# 1. For Box2D environments (BipedalWalker, LunarLander):
#    Covered by box2d-py in the main dependencies.
#
# 2. For Atari environments (Freeway):
#    If using zsh shell, you may encounter issues with brackets. 
#    Instead of `pip install gymnasium[atari,accept-rom-license]`, use:
#    `pip install ale-py` (included above)
#
#    Then in your code:
#    ```python
#    import gymnasium as gym
#    import ale-py
#    gym.register_envs(ale_py)
#    ```
#
# 3. For MuJoCo environments (if added in future):
#    `pip install "gymnasium[mujoco]"` (use quotes in zsh)

# To generate a complete list of ALL packages in your current environment:
# pip freeze > full_requirements.txt
