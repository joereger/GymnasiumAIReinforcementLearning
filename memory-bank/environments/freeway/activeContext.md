# Active Context: Freeway

**Current Work Focus (Freeway):**
- Implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for the Atari Freeway environment
- Focus on reward engineering to address the sparse reward challenge
- Adaptation of standard DQN architecture with customizations for this specific environment
- Robust error handling for RAM-based player position tracking

**Recent Changes (Freeway):**
1. **Initial Implementation**:
   - Created `freeway/freeway.py` implementing DQN with custom rewards
   - Set up project structure following repository standards
   - Established environment-specific data directory (`data/freeway/`)

2. **Environment Preprocessing**:
   - Implemented standard preprocessing pipeline (grayscale, resize, frame stacking)
   - Set up custom reward wrapper with enhanced learning signals
   - Developed robust RAM-based position tracking with error handling and diagnostics
   - Fixed initial RAM addressing issue (changed from 0x94 to 0x86)

3. **Neural Network Architecture**:
   - Designed 4-layer CNN + 3-layer FC network as specified
   - Implemented experience replay with configurable buffer size
   - Added target network with periodic updates for stable learning

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive Memory Bank documentation
   - Documented approaches, system patterns, and technical context
   - Established frameworks for tracking progress and performance

**Next Steps (Freeway):**
1. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Run initial training sessions with visual display
   - Tune reward engineering parameters if needed
   - Document training results and performance metrics

2. **Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Experiment with different ε-decay schedules to optimize exploration
   - Consider modifications to network architecture if performance issues arise
   - Potentially implement prioritized experience replay for more efficient learning

3. **Potential Extensions**:
   - Explore Rainbow DQN or PPO implementations for comparison
   - Investigate curiosity-driven exploration for improved learning

**Active Decisions and Considerations (Freeway):**
- **Reward Balance**: Currently using multiple reward components (zone-based, movement-based, time penalty). We may need to adjust the weighting between these components based on training results.
- **Exploration Strategy**: Using standard ε-greedy with relatively slow decay (0.995 per episode) to ensure sufficient exploration of the environment.
- **Model Persistence**: Saving both periodic checkpoints and best-performing models to balance training continuity and performance preservation.

**Key Implementation Challenges:**
1. **Sparse Reward Structure**: The original environment only provides rewards upon successful crossing, creating a challenging learning problem.
2. **Visual Complexity**: The Atari game's visual input requires significant preprocessing and a capable neural network to interpret.
3. **Temporal Dependencies**: Successfully crossing requires understanding the timing patterns of traffic, necessitating the frame stacking approach.
4. **RAM-Based Position Tracking**: Atari RAM memory layout varies across implementations, requiring robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for player position tracking.

**Learnings and Project Insights (So Far):**
- The combination of DQN with custom rewards has shown promise in similar environments with sparse rewards
- RAM-based position tracking provides more precise reward shaping than vision-based alternatives, but requires careful implementation with error handling
- Diagnostic RAM information during initialization helps identify correct memory addresses
- Maintaining visualization options during training is valuable for understanding agent behavior and debugging
- Defensive programming techniques (try/except blocks, fallbacks, debug logging) are essential when working with external environments like ALE
