# PPO Minimal Implementation for Pong

This is a minimal, self-contained PPO implementation designed to diagnose and fix issues with learning in the Pong Atari environment. The implementation has been heavily instrumented with diagnostics to identify potential problems with the PPO algorithm.

## Key Features

1. **Modular Design**: The code is split into logical components for easier debugging:
   - `pong_ppo_minimal_env.py`: Environment wrappers and preprocessing
   - `pong_ppo_minimal_model.py`: Neural network architecture
   - `pong_ppo_minimal_ppo.py`: PPO algorithm implementation
   - `pong_ppo_minimal_train.py`: Training loops and data collection
   - `pong_ppo_minimal.py`: Main entry point

2. **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Extensive visualizations and logging including:
   - Action distributions and entropy
   - Network activations
   - Reward, value, and advantage statistics
   - Training metrics and learning curves

## Critical Fixes for Learning

The following improvements are critical for learning in Pong with PPO:

1. **Proper Network Initialization**:
   - Using orthogonal initialization with appropriate gain values
   - Especially important for the final layers of policy and value heads

2. **Corrected GAE Calculation**:
   - Properly handling episode boundaries
   - Zeroing out advantages at the end of episodes
   - Adding numerical stability safeguards

3. **Enhanced Exploration**:
   - Temperature-based sampling for the first 10% of each rollout
   - Properly balancing entropy coefficient (0.01)

4. **Numerical Stability Safeguards**:
   - Clipping logits to prevent extreme values
   - Adding bounds to probabilities
   - Safety checks for NaN/Inf values
   - Proper advantage normalization with safeguards

5. **Optimized Training Parameters**:
   - Learning rate of 3e-4 (OpenAI standard)
   - PPO clip range of 0.1 (more stable than 0.2)
   - Larger batch size (128) for more stable updates
   - More optimization epochs (8) per batch of data

## Usage

To train the agent:
```bash
python pong/pong_ppo_minimal.py --total_timesteps 1000000 --diagnostic_mode
```

For faster training with diagnostic output:
```bash
python pong/pong_ppo_minimal.py --total_timesteps 100000 --rollout_steps 4096 --diagnostic_mode
```

To evaluate a trained agent:
```bash
python pong/pong_ppo_minimal.py --eval_only --model_path data/pong/models/best_model.pt --render
```

## Diagnosing Your Own Implementation

If you're debugging your own PPO implementation, check for these common issues:

1. **NaN/Infinity Values**: These can silently break training. Add explicit checks in:
   - Advantage normalization
   - Log probability calculations
   - Policy ratio calculations

2. **Improper Episode Handling**: Ensure advantages are reset at episode boundaries and terminal states are handled correctly.

3. **Network Architecture**: Check:
   - Weight initialization (orthogonal is best for RL)
   - Activation functions (ReLU is standard)
   - Network size (too small or too large can cause issues)

4. **Training Stability**:
   - Use action distributions with proper entropy
   - Normalize observations and rewards
   - Use stable optimization parameters

The most important lesson: Deep RL requires extensive diagnostics to ensure every component works correctly.
