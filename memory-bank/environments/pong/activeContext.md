# Pong Active Context

## Current Status (Last Updated: 5/11/2025)

We have **pivoted from DQN to PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** for the Pong environment. After thorough diagnostics with the DQN implementation, we identified several issues that were complicating the learning process. PPO was chosen as a more robust alternative that typically offers better sample efficiency and stability.

## Current Implementation

Our current focus is on the **PPO implementation** with the following key characteristics:

1. **Environment Wrappers**: We've consolidated the environment wrappers into a dedicated module (`pong_env_wrappers.py`) ensuring:
   * Proper frame preprocessing (grayscale, resizing to 84x84)
   * Frame stacking (4 frames) in channels-first format for PyTorch
   * Essential Atari-specific wrappers including `FireResetEnv`, `NoopResetEnv`, etc.
   * Reduced action space of 3 actions (STAY, UP, DOWN) for efficiency

2. **PPO Architecture**:
   * Actor-Critic network with shared CNN backbone
   * Separate policy (actor) and value (critic) heads
   * Uses Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
   * Implements the clipped surrogate objective for stability
   * Includes entropy regularization to encourage exploration

3. **Hyperparameters**:
   * Learning rate: 2.5e-4
   * Gamma (discount factor): 0.99
   * GAE Lambda: 0.95
   * Clip epsilon: 0.2
   * Multiple optimization epochs (4) per rollout
   * Rollout length: 128 steps
   * Normalized advantages for reduced variance

4. **Training Infrastructure**:
   * Regular evaluations (every 10,000 steps)
   * Model checkpointing (every 100,000 steps)
   * Training progress visualization
   * Small exploration during evaluation (epsilon=0.05)

5. **Visualization Capabilities**:
   * Policy attention visualization
   * Action distribution tracking
   * Training curve generation
   * Video recording of agent gameplay

## Next Steps

1. **Initial PPO Training**: Run the PPO implementation for approximately 1 million steps to establish a baseline performance level. We expect to see significant improvement over random policy within the first 100,000-200,000 steps.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: If initial results are promising but suboptimal, experiment with:
   * Increasing rollout length (higher sample collection before updates)
   * Adjusting entropy coefficient (exploration vs. exploitation balance)
   * Modifying learning rate schedule

3. **Advanced Techniques**: If needed, explore enhancements such as:
   * Curiosity-driven exploration
   * Self-supervised auxiliary tasks
   * Frame skipping adjustments

4. **Documentation**: Once we have established successful performance, thoroughly document PPO advantages compared to DQN for this specific environment in the memory bank.

## Discontinued Approaches

The DQN implementation has been set aside due to learning instability issues, specifically:
* Potential issues with value overestimation
* Sensitivity to initialization
* Long replay buffer warmup requirements
* Difficulty in coordinating target network update frequency

We've preserved the diagnostic tools from the DQN implementation for reference and future analysis.
