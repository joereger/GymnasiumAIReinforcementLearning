# Progress: Lunar Lander Solutions

**Overall Status (Lunar Lander):** Memory Bank files initialized. The existing solution (`lunar_lander.py`) needs to be documented within this Memory Bank structure.

**What Works (Lunar Lander - Memory Bank):**
- All standard Memory Bank files for Lunar Lander have been created with placeholder content:
    - `environment_brief.md`
    - `approaches.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
    - This `progress.md` file.

**What's Left to Build (Lunar Lander - Documentation & Solution):**
- **Detailed Documentation in `approaches.md`:**
    - Review `lunar_lander.py`: Document its algorithm, hyperparameters, performance, and learnings.
- **Documentation in `systemPatterns.md`:** Extract and document system patterns from the `lunar_lander.py` code.
- **Documentation in `techContext.md`:** Detail specific technologies used in the `lunar_lander.py` solution.
- **Solution Refinement/Development:** (Based on future tasks)
    - Potentially improve the existing solution.
    - Conduct further experiments if needed.

**Current Status of Implemented Approach (`lunar_lander.py`):**
- Status: Implemented.
- Nature of solution: (To be identified and documented - discrete or continuous action space version).
- Performance: (To be documented).
- Next Steps: Document in `approaches.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

**Known Issues (Lunar Lander Solution):**
- (To be filled in as the solution is reviewed or new issues arise).

**Evolution of Decisions (Lunar Lander):**
- (To be filled in if any significant design changes occur).

*(This file will track the progress of documenting and refining the solution for the Lunar Lander environment.)*
