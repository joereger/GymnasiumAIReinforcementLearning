# Progress: Pong (`ALE/PongNoFrameskip-v4`)

**Overall Status:** Initial setup phase for the Pong environment solution.

**Current Phase:** Environment Setup and Initial Memory Bank Population.

**Completed Steps:**
1.  **Directory Structure Created (Root Level):**
    *   `pong/` directory created for Python solution code.
    *   `data/pong/` directory created for storing environment-specific data (models, logs, etc.).
2.  **Memory Bank Structure Created (`memory-bank/environments/pong/`):**
    *   `memory-bank/environments/pong/` directory created.
    *   `environment_brief.md`: Created and populated with details about `ALE/PongNoFrameskip-v4`.
    *   `approaches.md`: Created and populated with the DQN "Smart Defaults" strategy.
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: Created and populated with Python code snippets for preprocessing, frame stacking, DQN model, and replay buffer, based on "Smart Defaults".
    *   `techContext.md`: Created and populated with relevant technologies, libraries, and technical considerations for Pong.
    *   `activeContext.md`: Created and populated, outlining current tasks and next steps for Pong.

**What's Working:**
-   Basic directory and Memory Bank file structure for Pong is in place.
-   Initial documentation reflecting the "Smart Defaults" plan is complete.

**What's Next:**
1.  **Create `pong/pong_dqn.py`:**
    *   Implement all core components: `preprocess`, `FrameStack`, `PongDQN` model, `ReplayBuffer`.
    *   Implement the `DQNAgent` class or equivalent logic (action selection, learning, target updates).
    *   Set up hyperparameters as per "Smart Defaults".
    *   Develop the main training loop.
    *   Add evaluation and plotting utilities.
    *   Confirm and use the correct action space for `ALE/PongNoFrameskip-v4`.
2.  **Initial Code Testing:**
    *   Ensure the environment can be created and reset.
    *   Test preprocessing and frame stacking.
    *   Verify the DQN model can be instantiated and perform a forward pass.
    *   Test the replay buffer functionality.
3.  **Training Run:**
    *   Perform an initial training run to check for major issues and observe learning behavior.
4.  **Refinement and Iteration:**
    *   Debug any issues found during initial testing and training.
    *   Tune hyperparameters if necessary based on initial results.
5.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Update this `progress.md` file as milestones are achieved.
    *   Update `activeContext.md` with ongoing work.
    *   Potentially refine `approaches.md` or `systemPatterns.md` if any deviations from the initial plan occur.
6.  **Update Top-Level Memory Bank:**
    *   Update project-level `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect that work on the Pong environment has commenced.

**Known Issues/Challenges:**
-   None specific to Pong yet, beyond the general complexities of training RL agents.
-   Need to confirm the exact action space of `ALE/PongNoFrameskip-v4` when implementing `pong_dqn.py`.

**Timeline Estimation (Rough):**
-   Initial `pong_dqn.py` implementation: 1-2 sessions.
-   Testing and Debugging: 1 session.
-   Initial Training Run & Observation: Ongoing.
