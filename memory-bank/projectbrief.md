# Project Brief: Gymnasium Environment Solutions

**Overall Goal:** To systematically work through and develop solutions for various OpenAI Gymnasium environments.

**Core Objectives:**
- Implement and experiment with different reinforcement learning algorithms and other problem-solving approaches for each selected environment.
- Document the process, challenges, learnings, and performance of each solution.
- Build a reusable and understandable codebase for tackling Gymnasium problems.
- Establish a robust Memory Bank to maintain context and facilitate ongoing development and understanding of the project.

**Scope:**
- Focus on selected Gymnasium environments (initially Bipedal Walker, Cart Pole, Lunar Lander, Mountain Car).
- Develop one or more distinct approaches for each environment.
- Maintain clear, isolated documentation for each environment and its solutions.
- Utilize a structured Memory Bank system for project context management.
