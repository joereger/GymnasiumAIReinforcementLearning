# Tech Context: Lunar Lander Solutions

This document outlines the technologies, libraries, and specific configurations used primarily for developing solutions for the Lunar Lander environment.

**Core Libraries (Beyond Global Project Context):**
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras:** (Specify the deep learning framework used in `lunar_lander.py`).
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.

**Key Python Packages (Specific to Lunar Lander):**
- (List any Python packages particularly important for Lunar Lander solutions, e.g., specific optimization libraries if not part of the core DL framework).

**Development & Experimentation Tools:**
- **Checkpointing:** (How models are saved and loaded during training for Lunar Lander solutions).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** (Tools or methods used, e.g., Optuna, Ray Tune, manual search, grid search).
- **Visualization:** (Specific plotting for learning curves, episode rewards, or agent behavior during landing. Use of TensorBoard or similar tools).

**Hardware Considerations:**
- **GPU Usage:** (Whether GPUs are beneficial or typically used for training Lunar Lander agents).

*(This file will be updated as specific technologies or configurations are identified from the `lunar_lander.py` solution.)*
