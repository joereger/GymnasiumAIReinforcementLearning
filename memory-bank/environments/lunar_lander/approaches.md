# Approaches: Lunar Lander

This document details the different solution approaches implemented or explored for the Lunar Lander environment.

## Approach 1: (Main Solution)

- **Source File:** `lunar_lander/lunar_lander.py`
- **Algorithm:** (To be determined by reviewing `lunar_lander.py` - likely a DQN for the discrete version or an actor-critic method like DDPG, TD3, or SAC for the continuous version).
- **Key Hyperparameters & Configuration:**
    - (To be filled in by reviewing `lunar_lander.py` - e.g., learning rates, discount factor, replay buffer size, network architectures for actor/critic, exploration strategy parameters).
- **Results & Performance:**
    - (To be filled in - e.g., average score achieved, number of episodes to solve, success rate of landing).
- **Learnings & Insights:**
    - (To be filled in - e.g., effectiveness of the chosen algorithm, challenges in tuning for smooth landing, impact of reward shaping if any).

*(This file will be updated as more details about the approach are documented or as new approaches are developed for Lunar Lander.)*
