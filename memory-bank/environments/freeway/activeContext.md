# Active Context: Freeway

**Current Work Focus (Freeway):**
- Multiple reinforcement learning approaches for the Atari Freeway environment
- Double DQN implementation with frame skipping for improved performance
- Hardware acceleration using Apple Silicon GPU via PyTorch MPS backend
- Focus on standard techniques from Atari DQN literature

**Recent Changes (Freeway):**
1. **Double DQN Implementation**:
   - Created `freeway/freeway_double_dqn.py` implementing Double DQN with frame skipping
   - Added hardware acceleration for Apple M1 chips
   - Implemented standard DeepMind 3-layer CNN architecture
   - Added frame skipping (4 frames) with max pooling

2. **Original DQN Implementation**:
   - Maintained `freeway/freeway.py` as baseline implementation
   - Enhanced with robust RAM-based position tracking
   - Implemented custom reward shaping

3. **Neural Network Architecture**:
   - Designed 4-layer CNN + 3-layer FC network as specified
   - Implemented experience replay with configurable buffer size
   - Added target network with periodic updates for stable learning

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive Memory Bank documentation
   - Documented approaches, system patterns, and technical context
   - Established frameworks for tracking progress and performance

**Next Steps (Freeway):**
1. **Training and Comparison**:
   - Run training sessions with both implementations
   - Compare vanilla DQN vs Double DQN performance
   - Measure impact of frame skipping on training efficiency
   - Evaluate hardware acceleration benefits on Apple Silicon

2. **Further Algorithm Enhancements**:
   - Consider implementing Prioritized Experience Replay
   - Explore Dueling DQN architecture
   - Potentially combine multiple enhancements into Rainbow DQN

3. **Results Documentation**:
   - Document training curves and performance metrics
   - Analyze maximum achievable scores
   - Compare against published benchmarks for Freeway

**Active Decisions and Considerations (Freeway):**
- **Reward Balance**: Currently using multiple reward components (zone-based, movement-based, time penalty). We may need to adjust the weighting between these components based on training results.
- **Exploration Strategy**: Using standard Îµ-greedy with relatively slow decay (0.995 per episode) to ensure sufficient exploration of the environment.
- **Model Persistence**: Saving both periodic checkpoints and best-performing models to balance training continuity and performance preservation.

**Key Implementation Challenges:**
1. **Sparse Reward Structure**: The original environment only provides rewards upon successful crossing, creating a challenging learning problem.
2. **Visual Complexity**: The Atari game's visual input requires significant preprocessing and a capable neural network to interpret.
3. **Temporal Dependencies**: Successfully crossing requires understanding the timing patterns of traffic, necessitating the frame stacking approach.
4. **Algorithm Selection**: Different DQN variants have different strengths - balancing complexity vs. performance improvement.
5. **Hardware Optimization**: Ensuring optimal performance on Apple Silicon requires proper PyTorch configuration.

**Learnings and Project Insights (So Far):**
- DQN variants such as Double DQN have strong theoretical advantages for Atari games like Freeway
- Frame skipping is critical for efficient training in Atari environments
- The standard 3-layer CNN architecture from DeepMind papers is sufficient for Freeway
- PyTorch with MPS backend provides significant acceleration on Apple Silicon hardware
- Using the recommended hyperparameters from literature (lr=0.00025, etc.) is important
- RAM-based position tracking requires careful implementation with robust error handling
- Defensive programming techniques are essential when working with external environments like ALE
