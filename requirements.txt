# --- Notes ---
# The list above includes primary dependencies. Versions updated based on dependency requirements.
# Previous conflict was resolved by:
# 1. Downgrading numpy from 2.2.5 to 1.25.2 to satisfy tensorflow's requirement (numpy<2.0.0,>=1.23.5).
#
# If further conflicts persist, try removing specific version pins to let pip resolve dependencies.
# For example, you might try: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade --no-deps` and then
# `pip check` to see if there are any issues with the installed packages.

# For specific Gymnasium environment families, you might need extras beyond box2d.
# For example, for Atari:
# gymnasium[atari]
# gymnasium[accept-rom-license] # if using Atari ROMs

# To generate a complete list of ALL packages in your current environment:
# pip freeze > full_requirements.txt
