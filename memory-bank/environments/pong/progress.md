# Pong Implementation Progress

This document tracks our progress implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the Pong environment.

## Current State (Last Updated: 5/11/2025)

- **Environment**: `PongNoFrameskip-v4`
- **Status**: Resolved critical implementation issues in both DQN and PPO approaches 
- **Best Performance**: PPO shows promising results, DQN fixed with proper wrappers

## Implementation Timeline

### Initial Implementation (Problematic)

- Implemented standard DQN architecture
- Used 4-frame stacking and epsilon-greedy exploration
- **Result**: Agent couldn't learn, stuck at -21 reward (complete loss)
- **Problem**: Missing critical environment wrappers and improper tensor shape handling

### Diagnostic Work

- Created `pong_diagnostic.py` to analyze environment behavior
- Visualized preprocessed frames and confirmed tensor shape issues
- Identified missing essential wrappers:
  - FireResetEnv (critical - game never starts without FIRE action)
  - NoopResetEnv
  - EpisodicLifeEnv
  - MaxAndSkipEnv
- Discovered incorrect channels ordering

### Fixed Implementations

1. **Fixed DQN**: 
   - Added all essential Atari wrappers
   - Corrected tensor dimension ordering (channels-first for PyTorch)
   - Implemented proper preprocessing pipeline
   - State: Ready for training

2. **PPO Implementation**:
   - Implemented PPO with proper GAE advantage estimation
   - Added proper Atari wrappers
   - Corrected tensor dimension handling
   - State: Training successfully

## Next Steps

1. **Run Extended Training**:
   - Train both implementations for 1-2M frames
   - Evaluate training stability and final performance
   - Compare learning curves

2. **Optimization Exploration**:
   - Experiment with reduced action space (6 vs 3 actions)
   - Test different hyperparameter settings
   - Explore frame skipping settings

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update approach comparisons with quantitative results
   - Prepare visualization of learning progress
