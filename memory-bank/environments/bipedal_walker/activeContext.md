# Active Context: Bipedal Walker Solutions

**Current Work Focus (Bipedal Walker):**
- Initial setup of Memory Bank files for the Bipedal Walker environment.
- Placeholder content created for `environment_brief.md`, `approaches.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, this `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

**Recent Changes (Bipedal Walker):**
- Created all foundational Memory Bank files within the `memory-bank/environments/bipedal_walker/` directory.

**Next Steps (Bipedal Walker):**
- **Populate `approaches.md`:** Review existing solution files (`bipedal_walker-a3c.py`, `bipedal_walker_plus_genetic_algorithm.py`, `bipedal_walker.py`) to fill in details about algorithms, hyperparameters, results, and learnings for each approach.
- **Populate `systemPatterns.md`:** Identify and document common system patterns from the existing Bipedal Walker solution code.
- **Populate `techContext.md`:** Detail any specific technologies or libraries used in the Bipedal Walker solutions.
- **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the current status of each implemented approach for Bipedal Walker.
- Begin experimentation or refinement of existing Bipedal Walker solutions if requested.

**Active Decisions and Considerations (Bipedal Walker):**
- How to best summarize and compare the different existing approaches (`A3C`, `GA`, and the generic `bipedal_walker.py`).
- Determining the level of detail required for hyperparameter logging in `approaches.md`.

**Learnings and Insights (Bipedal Walker - Initial Memory Bank Setup):**
- Having dedicated files for each aspect (brief, approaches, patterns, tech, active, progress) within the environment's folder provides a clear and organized structure.
