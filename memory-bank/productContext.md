# Product Context: Gymnasium Environment Solutions

**Why This Project Exists:**
This project serves as a hands-on learning platform for exploring and mastering reinforcement learning (RL) concepts and techniques. OpenAI Gymnasium provides a diverse set of standardized environments ideal for this purpose. The goal is to build a personal repository of solved environments, showcasing different algorithmic approaches and their effectiveness.

**Problems It Solves:**
- Provides a structured way to experiment with and compare various RL algorithms.
- Facilitates deeper understanding of RL principles through practical application.
- Creates a documented record of experiments, learnings, and challenges encountered while solving complex control problems.
- Builds a portfolio of demonstrable RL solutions.

**How It Should Work:**
- Each Gymnasium environment should be tackled systematically.
- For each environment, one or more distinct solution approaches (e.g., different algorithms, hyperparameter tuning strategies) should be implemented and evaluated.
- Code should be well-organized, with clear separation for each environment and solution.
- The Memory Bank should provide comprehensive context, allowing for easy understanding of past work, current status, and future plans for both the overall project and individual environments.

**User Experience Goals (for the AI Engineer/Developer):**
- **Clarity:** The project structure and Memory Bank should make it easy to understand the state of any given environment or solution attempt.
- **Isolation:** Context for one environment should not interfere with or confuse work on another.
- **Reproducibility:** Solutions should be documented well enough to be understood and potentially reproduced.
- **Efficiency:** The Memory Bank should enable quick onboarding and resumption of work after breaks or context switches.
