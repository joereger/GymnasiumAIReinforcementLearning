# Pong Implementation Progress

This document tracks our progress implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the Pong environment.

## Current State (Last Updated: 5/11/2025)

- **Environment**: `PongNoFrameskip-v4`
- **Status**: Enhanced PPO implementation with robust learning features
- **Primary Approach**: PPO with Actor-Critic architecture, GAE, and training continuity
- **Secondary Approach**: DQN implementation fixed but not actively developed
- **Best Performance**: Preparing for extended 25M timestep PPO training runs
- **Implementation File**: Consolidated to `pong_ppo.py` (renamed from `pong_ppo_train.py`)
- **Environment Wrapper Module**: Consolidated all wrappers into `pong_env_wrappers.py` with sound disabling

## Implementation Timeline

### Initial DQN Implementation (Earlier work)

- Implemented standard DQN architecture
- Used 4-frame stacking and epsilon-greedy exploration
- **Result**: Agent couldn't learn, stuck at -21 reward (complete loss)
- **Problem**: Missing critical environment wrappers and improper tensor shape handling

### Diagnostic Work

- Created `pong_diagnostic.py` to analyze environment behavior
- Visualized preprocessed frames and confirmed tensor shape issues
- Identified missing essential wrappers:
  - FireResetEnv (critical - game never starts without FIRE action)
  - NoopResetEnv
  - EpisodicLifeEnv
  - MaxAndSkipEnv
- Discovered incorrect channels ordering

### DQN Improvements

- Added all essential Atari wrappers
- Corrected tensor dimension ordering (channels-first for PyTorch)
- Implemented proper preprocessing pipeline
- Reduced action space from 6 to 3 actions
- Created extensive DQN debugging tools
- **Result**: Fixed implementation showed initial learning but had stability issues

### Initial PPO Implementation

- Consolidated environment wrappers into dedicated module (`pong_env_wrappers.py`)
- Implemented complete PPO architecture with Actor-Critic network
- Added Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Implemented clipped surrogate objective
- Added entropy regularization
- Created comprehensive training, evaluation, and visualization tools

### Enhanced PPO Implementation (5/11/2025)

- **Renamed to `pong_ppo.py`** from `pong_ppo_train.py` for simplicity
- **Dramatically extended training horizon** to 25M timesteps (from 1M)
- **Added training continuity** to allow stopping and resuming:
  - Automatically tracks training progress in JSON format
  - Loads progress data when resuming training
  - Preserves episode count, timesteps, and timing information
- **Improved metrics tracking**:
  - Added best model tracking and preservation
  - Saves copy of best model as `ppo_pong_best.pt`
- **Enhanced visualization**:
  - Created single unified chart with multiple axes
  - Removed unnecessary metrics and focused on key performance indicators
  - Added proper legends and color coding
- **Improved usability**:
  - Added episode-based logging with single-line output
  - Time formatting in HH:MM:SS format
  - Interactive model selection for resuming training
  - Optional real-time game rendering during training
- **Optimization improvements**:
  - Sound disabling for distraction-free training
  - Modern Gymnasium seeding through `reset(seed=...)`
  - Episode-based evaluation (every 500 episodes rather than step-based)
  - Episode-based model saving (every 100 episodes)

## Enhanced PPO Architecture Overview

1. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Same Atari wrappers as before but with sound disabling
   - Reduced action space (3 actions)
   - Channels-first tensor format
   - Fixed seeding with modern Gymnasium API

2. **Policy Network**:
   - Shared CNN backbone (3 convolutional layers)
   - Separate actor (policy) and critic (value) heads
   - Handles stacked frames (4x84x84)

3. **Training Infrastructure**:
   - 128-step rollouts for experience collection
   - Multiple optimization epochs per rollout
   - Advantage normalization
   - Episode-based evaluation (every 500 episodes)
   - Episode-based model saving (every 100 episodes)
   - Best model tracking and preservation
   - Training continuity with progress recovery
   - Improved visualization with unified charts

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Optional real-time game visualization
   - Interactive model loading for resumed training
   - Single-line progress logging with key metrics
   - HH:MM:SS time formatting

## Next Steps

1. **Extended PPO Training**:
   - Run PPO for 25M timesteps with default hyperparameters
   - Monitor learning progress and stability via unified charts
   - Expected significant improvement within first 500K-1M steps

2. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Track reward progression over time
   - Analyze policy and value loss trends
   - Evaluate entropy decay patterns
   - Study best-performing model behavior

3. **Hyperparameter Adaptation**:
   - Consider dynamic entropy coefficient adjustments during longer training
   - Evaluate learning rate decay schedules for 25M timestep training
   - Fine-tune GAE lambda for more stable advantage estimates

4. **Final Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive performance charts over full training period
   - Record videos of best-performing agent gameplay
   - Document lessons learned from long-term PPO training
   - Analyze how longer training affects policy refinement
