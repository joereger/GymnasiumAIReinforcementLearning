# Progress: Bipedal Walker Solutions

**Overall Status (Bipedal Walker):** Memory Bank files initialized. Existing solutions (`bipedal_walker-a3c.py`, `bipedal_walker_plus_genetic_algorithm.py`, `bipedal_walker.py`) need to be documented within this Memory Bank structure.

**What Works (Bipedal Walker - Memory Bank):**
- All standard Memory Bank files for Bipedal Walker have been created with placeholder content:
    - `environment_brief.md`
    - `approaches.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
    - This `progress.md` file.

**What's Left to Build (Bipedal Walker - Documentation & Solutions):**
- **Detailed Documentation in `approaches.md`:**
    - Review `bipedal_walker-a3c.py`: Document its algorithm, hyperparameters, performance, and learnings.
    - Review `bipedal_walker_plus_genetic_algorithm.py`: Document its algorithm, hyperparameters, performance, and learnings.
    - Review `bipedal_walker.py`: Identify its approach and document it similarly.
- **Documentation in `systemPatterns.md`:** Extract and document common and approach-specific system patterns from the code.
- **Documentation in `techContext.md`:** Detail specific technologies used in the Bipedal Walker solutions.
- **Solution Refinement/Development:** (Based on future tasks)
    - Potentially improve existing solutions.
    - Develop new approaches.
    - Conduct further experiments and hyperparameter tuning.

**Current Status of Implemented Approaches:**
- **A3C (`bipedal_walker-a3c.py`):**
    - Status: Implemented.
    - Performance: (To be documented).
    - Next Steps: Document in `approaches.md`.
- **Genetic Algorithm (`bipedal_walker_plus_genetic_algorithm.py`):**
    - Status: Implemented.
    - Performance: (To be documented).
    - Next Steps: Document in `approaches.md`.
- **Generic/Initial (`bipedal_walker.py`):**
    - Status: Implemented.
    - Nature of solution: (To be identified and documented).
    - Performance: (To be documented).
    - Next Steps: Identify approach and document in `approaches.md`.

**Known Issues (Bipedal Walker Solutions):**
- (To be filled in as solutions are reviewed or new issues arise, e.g., "GA solution is slow to converge," "A3C solution is unstable with X hyperparameters").

**Evolution of Decisions (Bipedal Walker):**
- (To be filled in as development progresses, e.g., "Switched from X optimizer to Y due to better performance for A3C").

*(This file will track the progress of developing, documenting, and refining solutions for the Bipedal Walker environment.)*
