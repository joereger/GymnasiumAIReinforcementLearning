# Tech Context: Gymnasium Environment Solutions

**Core Technologies:**
- **Python:** The primary programming language for all development. (Specify version if known, e.g., Python 3.9+).
- **OpenAI Gymnasium:** The core library providing the suite of reinforcement learning environments. (Specify version if known, e.g., Gymnasium 0.29.x).
- **Reinforcement Learning Libraries:** (List any common RL libraries used across multiple environments, e.g., Stable Baselines3, RLlib, or custom implementations). If solutions are primarily custom, note that.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations, especially array manipulations for observations and actions.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Pygame (via Gymnasium):** For visualization of environment states, agent performance, or rendering environments. `visualization_utils.py` likely uses these.

**Development Setup:**
- **Operating System:** (User's OS, e.g., macOS, Windows, Linux).
- **IDE/Editor:** VSCode.
- **Virtual Environment:** Managed via `GymnasiumVENV/` (likely using `venv` or `conda`).
- **Version Control:** Git (assumed, as `.gitignore` is present).

**Technical Constraints:**
- Solutions should be runnable within the provided Gymnasium environments.
- Computational resources might be a constraint for training complex agents on some environments.

**Dependencies:**
- Key dependencies are managed within `GymnasiumVENV/`. A `requirements.txt` file might exist or could be generated to list specific package versions.
- Common dependencies include:
    - `gymnasium`
    - `numpy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - Potentially specific RL framework libraries.

**Tool Usage Patterns:**
- **Cline:** Used as an AI software engineer, relying on the Memory Bank for context.
- **VSCode:** Primary development environment.
- **Terminal (within VSCode or standalone):** For running Python scripts, managing virtual environments, and Git operations.
