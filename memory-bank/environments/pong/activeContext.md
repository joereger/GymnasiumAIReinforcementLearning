# Pong Active Context

## Current Status (Last Updated: 5/11/2025)

We have successfully identified and fixed critical issues in our Pong implementations. Both our DQN and PPO approaches now include all essential Atari environment wrappers and properly handle tensor dimensions for PyTorch.

## Root Causes of Previous Failures

Our diagnostic work revealed several critical issues that were preventing learning:

1. **Missing Environment Wrappers**: 
   - FireResetEnv (critical - without this, the game never actually starts)
   - NoopResetEnv (important for random starting positions)
   - EpisodicLifeEnv (helps with value estimation)
   - MaxAndSkipEnv (improves efficiency)

2. **Incorrect Tensor Formatting**:
   - PyTorch expects channels-first format (C, H, W)
   - Our original implementation used channels-last (H, W, C)
   - This mismatch prevented effective feature learning in the CNN layers

3. **Preprocessing Issues**:
   - Improper frame processing order
   - Inconsistent normalization

## Fixed Implementations

1. **DQN Implementation Fixes**:
   - Added standard Atari wrappers in correct order
   - Fixed tensor dimension handling
   - Improved preprocessing pipeline
   - Added proper reset behavior with `FireResetEnv`

2. **PPO Implementation**:
   - Implemented with standard Atari wrappers
   - Used correct channels-first tensor ordering
   - Implemented proper Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
   - Added appropriate clipping and entropy terms

## Key Files

- `pong_diagnostic.py`: Diagnostic tool to analyze environment behavior
- `pong_dqn_utils.py`: Contains fixed environment wrappers and preprocessing
- `pong_dqn_model.py`: Deep Q-Network model with corrected tensor handling
- `pong_dqn_train.py`: Training loop with proper environment creation
- `pong_fixed_ppo.py`: PPO implementation with correct environment wrappers

## Current Experiments

Both implementations are ready for extended training to evaluate their performance:

1. **Fixed DQN**:
   - Target network updates every 1000 steps
   - Linear epsilon decay over 200k frames
   - Gradient clipping at 1.0
   - Replay buffer size of 100k

2. **PPO**:
   - Rollout length of 2048 steps
   - PPO clip parameter of 0.1
   - 4 optimization epochs per update
   - Value coefficient of 0.5, entropy coefficient of 0.01

## Next Actions

1. Run extended training on both implementations (1-2M frames)
2. Compare learning curves and final performance
3. Explore hyperparameter optimization
4. Gather comparative metrics

## Recent Progress Notes

We've resolved the fundamental issues preventing learning in our implementations. The diagnostic tool confirmed that:

1. The Pong environment requires pressing FIRE to start a game
2. Channels-first tensor format is essential for PyTorch
3. Fixed wrappers enable proper environment interaction
4. Both implementations are now correctly structured

Both our DQN and PPO implementations now show signs of learning improvement beyond the baseline -21 reward.
