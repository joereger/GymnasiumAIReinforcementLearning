# Active Context: Gymnasium Environment Solutions

**Current Work Focus (Project Level):**
- Finalizing project setup documentation: `README.md` and `requirements.txt`.
- Confirming all code uses the `gymnasium` library.

**Recent Changes (Project Level):**
- **Code Refactoring:**
    - Moved all environment-specific Python scripts into their respective new environment folders (e.g., `bipedal_walker/`, `cart_pole/`).
    - Copied `visualization_utils.py` into each environment's folder for self-containment.
- **Documentation Updates:**
    - Updated `.clinerules` with the "Code Structure Principle" and "Data Storage Principle" to read code from new directories and use environment-specific data directories.
    - Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` for new code organization and data structure.
    - Updated `Source File` paths in environment-specific `approaches.md` files.
- **Data Organization:**
    - Created environment-specific data directories (`data/bipedal_walker/`, `data/cart_pole/`, `data/lunar_lander/`, `data/mountain_car/`).
    - Updated all scripts to save and load data to/from their respective environment-specific data directories.
- **New Project Files:**
    - Created `README.md` with project overview, structure, approach summaries, and setup instructions.
    - Created `requirements.txt` with primary dependencies.
- **Library Confirmation & Updates:**
    - Verified that all Python solution scripts correctly use `import gymnasium as gym`.
    - Checked available `gymnasium` versions using `pip index versions`.
    - Updated `requirements.txt` to `gymnasium==1.1.1`.
    - User provided `pip list --outdated` output.
    - Updated `requirements.txt` again with latest available versions for core packages (e.g., `pygame`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `torch`, `box2d-py`) based on the outdated list.
    - User ran `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade` and encountered dependency conflicts (tensorflow-macos vs numpy/typing-extensions, torchvision vs torch).
    - Updated `requirements.txt` to include latest available `tensorflow-macos` and `torchvision` from `pip list --outdated` and explicitly added `typing-extensions` in an attempt to resolve conflicts.
    - User attempted upgrade again and encountered a specific conflict: tensorflow requires numpy<2.0.0,>=1.23.5.
    - Downgraded `numpy` from 2.2.5 to 1.25.2 in `requirements.txt` to be compatible with tensorflow's requirements.

**Next Steps (Project Level):**
- Update the top-level `progress.md` file.
- Request user to delete the original Python files from the project root directory as they are now redundant.
- Ensure consistent use of environment-specific data directories across all future implementations.
- Await further instructions or tasks from the user.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- Ensuring the Memory Bank structure aligns with the goal of strong isolation between environment contexts.
- Defining clear roles for top-level versus environment-specific Memory Bank files.

**Important Patterns and Preferences (Emerging):**
- Hierarchical documentation is preferred.
- Markdown is the standard for Memory Bank files.
- Self-contained code modules per environment to ensure isolation and independent operation.

**Learnings and Project Insights (So Far):**
- A structured Memory Bank is crucial for managing a project with multiple distinct sub-components (the Gymnasium environments).
- The folder-per-environment approach for both Memory Bank documentation and actual code enhances clarity and context isolation.
- Duplication of utility code is acceptable for the sake of self-containment and independent runnable environments.
