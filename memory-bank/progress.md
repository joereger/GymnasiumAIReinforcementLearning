# Progress: Gymnasium Environment Solutions

**Overall Project Status:** Code refactoring to folder-per-environment structure complete. Memory Bank documentation updated.

**What Works (Project Level):**
- **Memory Bank Structure:**
    - All top-level Memory Bank files created and populated with initial content.
    - `memory-bank/environments/` directory created with subdirectories for `bipedal_walker`, `cart_pole`, `lunar_lander`, and `mountain_car`.
    - Each environment subdirectory contains a full set of placeholder Memory Bank files.
    - `.clinerules` file created and updated with Memory Bank access rules and the new code structure principle.
- **Code Structure:**
    - Dedicated root-level directories created for each environment: `bipedal_walker/`, `cart_pole/`, `lunar_lander/`, `mountain_car/`.
    - All respective Python solution scripts have been moved into these directories.
    - `visualization_utils.py` has been copied into each environment directory to ensure self-containment.
- **Data Organization:**
    - Environment-specific data directories created at `data/bipedal_walker/`, `data/cart_pole/`, `data/lunar_lander/`, and `data/mountain_car/`.
    - Scripts updated to save and load models, results, and other artifacts to/from these environment-specific data directories.
    - This ensures data isolation between environments, preventing accidental overwrites and maintaining the self-containment principle.
- **Memory Bank Updates:**
    - Top-level `systemPatterns.md` updated to reflect new code structure and data organization.
    - `.clinerules` updated with the "Data Storage Principle" to formalize the use of environment-specific data directories.
    - Environment-specific `approaches.md` files updated with new source file paths.
    - Top-level `activeContext.md` and this `progress.md` file updated.
- **Project Documentation:**
    - `README.md` created with project overview, structure, and setup instructions.
    - `requirements.txt` created and updated multiple times to reflect latest available package versions for core libraries (gymnasium, pygame, numpy, torch, torchvision, tensorflow-macos, box2d-py, cloudpickle, typing-extensions).
- **Library Usage:**
    - Confirmed all existing Python solution scripts use `import gymnasium as gym`.
    - Checked available `gymnasium` versions via `pip index versions`.
    - User provided `pip list --outdated` output, which informed `requirements.txt` updates.
    - User attempted `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade` which led to dependency conflicts.
    - Second attempt at upgrade revealed specific conflict: tensorflow requires numpy<2.0.0,>=1.23.5.
    - Downgraded numpy from 2.2.5 to 1.25.2 in `requirements.txt` to be compatible with tensorflow's requirements.

**What's Left to Build (Project Level):**
- **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:** User needs to run `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade` with the latest numpy-adjusted `requirements.txt`. If conflicts persist, consider more flexible version specifications.
- **Populate Memory Bank Content:** Detailed documentation of algorithms, hyperparameters, results, and learnings needs to be added to the placeholder files within each environment's Memory Bank, based on reviewing the actual code.
- **Delete Redundant Root-Level Files:** The original Python scripts (`bipedal_walker*.py`, `cart_pole.py`, `lunar_lander.py`, `mountain_car_discrete.py`, `visualization_utils.py`) at the project root need to be deleted by the user.
- **Ensure Data Directory Usage:** Verify all future implementations follow the environment-specific data directory pattern for saving and loading models and results.

**Current Status of Environments (High-Level):**
- **Bipedal Walker:** Code (`bipedal_walker/bipedal_walker_plus_genetic_algorithm.py`, `bipedal_walker/bipedal_walker-a3c.py`, `bipedal_walker/bipedal_walker.py`, `bipedal_walker/visualization_utils.py`) refactored into `bipedal_walker/` directory. Memory Bank files created.
- **Cart Pole:** Code (`cart_pole/cart_pole.py`, `cart_pole/visualization_utils.py`) refactored into `cart_pole/` directory. Memory Bank files created.
- **Lunar Lander:** Code (`lunar_lander/lunar_lander.py`, `lunar_lander/visualization_utils.py`) refactored into `lunar_lander/` directory. Memory Bank files created.
- **Mountain Car:** Code (`mountain_car/mountain_car_discrete.py`, `mountain_car/visualization_utils.py`) refactored into `mountain_car/` directory. Memory Bank files created.
- **Other Environments:** Not yet started.

**Known Issues (Project Level):**
- Redundant Python files exist at the project root and need manual deletion.
- Potential dependency conflicts when upgrading packages. The latest `requirements.txt` addresses the numpy/tensorflow conflict by downgrading numpy from 2.2.5 to 1.25.2 to satisfy tensorflow's requirement (numpy<2.0.0,>=1.23.5).

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Decision made to adopt a hierarchical, folder-per-environment Memory Bank structure.
- Decision made to refactor code into a folder-per-environment structure at the project root, with each environment's code being self-contained (including duplicated utilities if necessary).
- Decision made to create environment-specific data directories to maintain strict isolation between different environments' data and artifacts.
