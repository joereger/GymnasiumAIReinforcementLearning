# Active Context: Gymnasium Environment Solutions

**Current Work Focus (Project Level):**
- Initializing and structuring the Cline Memory Bank for the Gymnasium solutions project.
- Establishing the foundational Memory Bank files and the directory structure for individual environments.

**Recent Changes (Project Level):**
- Created top-level Memory Bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.
- Defined the folder-per-environment strategy for `memory-bank/environments/`.

**Next Steps (Project Level):**
- Create the `progress.md` top-level file.
- Create the `memory-bank/environments/` directory.
- Populate `memory-bank/environments/` with subdirectories for each identified environment (`bipedal_walker`, `cart_pole`, `lunar_lander`, `mountain_car`).
- Create the standard set of Memory Bank files within each environment's subdirectory.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- Ensuring the Memory Bank structure aligns with the goal of strong isolation between environment contexts.
- Defining clear roles for top-level versus environment-specific Memory Bank files.

**Important Patterns and Preferences (Emerging):**
- Hierarchical documentation is preferred.
- Markdown is the standard for Memory Bank files.

**Learnings and Project Insights (So Far):**
- A structured Memory Bank is crucial for managing a project with multiple distinct sub-components (the Gymnasium environments).
- The folder-per-environment approach seems well-suited for maintaining context isolation.
