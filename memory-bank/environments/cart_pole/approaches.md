# Approaches: Cart Pole

This document details the different solution approaches implemented or explored for the Cart Pole environment.

## Approach 1: (Main Solution)

- **Source File:** `cart_pole.py`
- **Algorithm:** (To be determined by reviewing `cart_pole.py` - likely a Q-learning, DQN, or policy gradient method given the environment's nature).
- **Key Hyperparameters & Configuration:**
    - (To be filled in by reviewing `cart_pole.py` - e.g., learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate (epsilon) for Q-learning/DQN, network architecture for DQN/PG).
- **Results & Performance:**
    - (To be filled in - e.g., average score achieved, number of episodes to solve, consistency of performance).
- **Learnings & Insights:**
    - (To be filled in - e.g., effectiveness of the chosen algorithm, impact of hyperparameter choices, common failure modes observed during training).

*(This file will be updated as more details about the approach are documented or as new approaches are developed for Cart Pole.)*
