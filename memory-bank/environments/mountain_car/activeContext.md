# Active Context: Mountain Car Solutions

**Current Work Focus (Mountain Car):**
- Initial setup of Memory Bank files for the Mountain Car environment.
- Placeholder content created for `environment_brief.md`, `approaches.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, this `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

**Recent Changes (Mountain Car):**
- Created all foundational Memory Bank files within the `memory-bank/environments/mountain_car/` directory.

**Next Steps (Mountain Car):**
- **Populate `approaches.md`:** Review `mountain_car_discrete.py` to determine the algorithm used and fill in details about its implementation, hyperparameters, results, and learnings.
- **Populate `systemPatterns.md`:** Identify and document system patterns from the `mountain_car_discrete.py` code, especially regarding state representation/discretization.
- **Populate `techContext.md`:** Detail any specific technologies used in the `mountain_car_discrete.py` solution.
- **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the current status of the implemented approach for Mountain Car.
- Begin experimentation or refinement of the Mountain Car solution if requested, or explore solutions for the continuous version.

**Active Decisions and Considerations (Mountain Car):**
- How to best document the state discretization or function approximation method used in `mountain_car_discrete.py`.

**Learnings and Insights (Mountain Car - Initial Memory Bank Setup):**
- The Memory Bank structure is consistently applied across all environments, including those with classic control challenges like Mountain Car.
