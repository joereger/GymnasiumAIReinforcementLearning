# System Patterns: Cart Pole Solutions

This document outlines system-level patterns, architectural choices, and common structures observed or employed specifically within the solutions developed for the Cart Pole environment.

**Common Patterns in Cart Pole Solutions (`cart_pole.py`):**
- **Agent Class Structure:** (Describe the structure of the agent, e.g., methods for choosing an action, updating the policy/value function).
- **Policy/Value Function Representation:**
    - For Q-learning: How the Q-table is structured and updated.
    - For DQN: Neural network architecture (e.g., simple feed-forward network), optimizer, loss function.
    - For Policy Gradient: Neural network architecture for the policy, how probabilities are calculated.
- **Exploration Strategy:** (e.g., Epsilon-greedy for Q-learning/DQN, or inherent stochasticity in policy gradient methods).
- **Learning Loop:** (Typical structure of the main training loop: environment interaction, data collection, agent updates).
- **State Discretization (If applicable):** (If continuous states are discretized for tabular methods, describe the binning strategy).

*(This file will be updated as common patterns are identified or refined from the `cart_pole.py` solution.)*
