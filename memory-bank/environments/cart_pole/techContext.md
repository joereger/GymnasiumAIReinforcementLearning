# Tech Context: Cart Pole Solutions

This document outlines the technologies, libraries, and specific configurations used primarily for developing solutions for the Cart Pole environment.

**Core Libraries (Beyond Global Project Context):**
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras:** (Specify if a particular deep learning framework is used in `cart_pole.py`, especially if it involves a neural network like in DQN).
- **NumPy:** Extensively used for handling states, actions, and Q-tables if applicable.

**Key Python Packages (Specific to Cart Pole):**
- (List any Python packages that are particularly important or unique to solving Cart Pole, beyond common ones. Given Cart Pole's simplicity, this might be minimal).

**Development & Experimentation Tools:**
- **Checkpointing:** (How models or Q-tables are saved/loaded, if at all, for Cart Pole solutions).
- **Visualization:** (Any specific plotting for learning curves, Q-value evolution, or policy changes, potentially using Matplotlib directly in `cart_pole.py` or via `visualization_utils.py`).

**Hardware Considerations:**
- **GPU Usage:** Typically not required for Cart Pole due to its simplicity. Solutions are usually CPU-bound.

*(This file will be updated as specific technologies or configurations are identified from the `cart_pole.py` solution.)*
