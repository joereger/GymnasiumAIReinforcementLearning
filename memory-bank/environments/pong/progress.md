# Pong Implementation Progress

This document tracks our progress implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the Pong environment.

## Current State (Last Updated: 5/11/2025)

- **Environment**: `PongNoFrameskip-v4`
- **Status**: Pivoted from DQN to PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Primary Approach**: PPO with Actor-Critic architecture and GAE
- **Secondary Approach**: DQN implementation fixed but not actively developed
- **Best Performance**: Preparing for full PPO training runs
- **Environment Wrapper Module**: Consolidated all wrappers into `pong_env_wrappers.py`

## Implementation Timeline

### Initial DQN Implementation (Earlier work)

- Implemented standard DQN architecture
- Used 4-frame stacking and epsilon-greedy exploration
- **Result**: Agent couldn't learn, stuck at -21 reward (complete loss)
- **Problem**: Missing critical environment wrappers and improper tensor shape handling

### Diagnostic Work

- Created `pong_diagnostic.py` to analyze environment behavior
- Visualized preprocessed frames and confirmed tensor shape issues
- Identified missing essential wrappers:
  - FireResetEnv (critical - game never starts without FIRE action)
  - NoopResetEnv
  - EpisodicLifeEnv
  - MaxAndSkipEnv
- Discovered incorrect channels ordering

### DQN Improvements

- Added all essential Atari wrappers
- Corrected tensor dimension ordering (channels-first for PyTorch)
- Implemented proper preprocessing pipeline
- Reduced action space from 6 to 3 actions
- Created extensive DQN debugging tools
- **Result**: Fixed implementation showed initial learning but had stability issues

### Current PPO Implementation (5/11/2025)

- Consolidated environment wrappers into dedicated module (`pong_env_wrappers.py`)
- Implemented complete PPO architecture with Actor-Critic network
- Added Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Implemented clipped surrogate objective
- Added entropy regularization
- Created comprehensive training, evaluation, and visualization tools:
  - `pong_ppo_model.py`: Model architecture and algorithm
  - `pong_ppo_train.py`: Training loop and infrastructure
  - `pong_ppo_vis.py`: Visualization and analysis tools
- Added policy attention visualization capabilities

## PPO Architecture Overview

1. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Same Atari wrappers as DQN
   - Reduced action space (3 actions)
   - Channels-first tensor format

2. **Policy Network**:
   - Shared CNN backbone (3 convolutional layers)
   - Separate actor (policy) and critic (value) heads
   - Handles stacked frames (4x84x84)

3. **Training Infrastructure**:
   - 128-step rollouts for experience collection
   - Multiple optimization epochs per rollout
   - Advantage normalization
   - Regular evaluation and model saving
   - Visualization of training progress

## Next Steps

1. **Initial PPO Training**:
   - Run PPO for 1M timesteps with default hyperparameters
   - Monitor learning progress and stability
   - Expected early learning within 100k-200k steps

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Experiment with rollout length
   - Adjust entropy coefficient
   - Test different learning rates

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Compare against DQN (if applicable)
   - Analyze policy attention maps
   - Generate training curves

4. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Test larger network architectures
   - Experiment with curiosity-driven exploration
   - Consider self-supervised auxiliary tasks

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update memory bank with quantitative results
   - Document PPO advantages for Pong environment
   - Create demonstration videos of trained agent
